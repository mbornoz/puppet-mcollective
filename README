= MCollective Puppet module =

Author: Atha Kouroussis <athak@vurbia.com> -  athak on Twitter.

A Comprehensive (as far as possible) puppet module for deploying and managing mcollective. Supports Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat/CentOS(not tested yet)

== Usage ==

To make a host member of a Collective:
include mcollective::node

To include the command line utilities (mc-*):
include mcollective::client

There is an additional mcollective::mongodb class that you can include on a host to act as an registration receiver with MongoDB. See:
- http://www.devco.net/archives/2010/09/18/puppet_search_engine_with_mcollective.php
- http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentRegistrationMongoDB

All classes provide default parameters (mcollective_*) that can be overridden to suit the environment.

Currently this module assumes that you have configured apt/yum sources for the mcollective packages. Will update soon with a solution to that
but it will require additional module dependencies.

== Requires ==
- Depends on concat module, available here:
  https://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat
- Depends on ruby module, available here:
  https://github.com/vurbia/puppet-ruby
- Depends on mcollective-plugins repository available under /files/plugins
  https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-plugins
  Its is configured as git submodule that has to be manually initialized with:
  git submodule init
  git submodule update


All contributions and suggestions are welcome!
